HANDE
=====

HANDE is an open-source software package for stochastic quantum chemistry under active development, run by a non-profit community of UK academics headed by Dr James Spencer (Imperial College London) and Dr Alex Thom (University of Cambridge).

HANDE contains highly scalable implementations of the full configuration interaction
quantum Monte Carlo [1]_ and coupled cluster Monte Carlo [2]_ methods including the
initiator approximation [3]_ and semi-stochastic approach [4]_, as well as the
density matrix quantum Monte Carlo method[5]_.
HANDE can treat a variety of quantum systems, including the molecular systems (via integrals obtained from a quantum chemistry package) and the uniform electron gas as well as the Hubbard and Heisenberg models.

We are currently preparing HANDE for a 1.0 release.  An early release candidate can be
obtained from https://github.com/hande-qmc/hande.

For any questions on using and/or developing HANDE, please contact James or Alex in the
first instance:
